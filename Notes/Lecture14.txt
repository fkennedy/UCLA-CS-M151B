Multilevel Caches
    Primary cache attached to CPU
        Small, but fast
    L-2 cache services misses from primary cache

Multilevel Cache Example
    Given
        BCPI = 1 (no other stalls, no hazards)
        CR = 4GHz       // CT = 0.25ns
        Miss rate/instruction = 2%
        Main Memory Access Time = 100ns
    With just primary cache
        Miss penalty = 100ns/0.25ns = 400 cycles
            Takes 400 cycles if there's a cache miss
        Effective CPI = 1 + 0.02*400 = 9

Example (cont.)
    Now add L-2 cache
        MMAT = 5ns
        MR = 10%
    Primary miss with L-2 hit
        Penalty = 5ns/0.25ns = 20 cycles
    Primary miss with L-2 miss
        Extra penalty = 400 cycles
    CPI = 1+0.02*(20+0.1*400) = 2.2
    Performance ratio = 9/2.2 = 4.1

Multilevel Cache Considerations
    Primary cache
        Focus on minimal hit time
    L-2 cache
        Focus on low miss rate to avoid main memory access
        Hit time has less overall impact
    Results
        L-1 cache usually smaller than a single cache
        L-1 block size smaller than L-2 block size

Interactions with Advanced CPUs
    Out-of-order CPUs can execut instructions during cache miss
        Pending stores stays in load/store unit
        Dependent instructions wait in reservation stations
            Independent instructions continue
    Effect of miss depends on program data flow
        Much harder to analyse
        Use system simulation

Interactions with Software
    Misses are dependent on the memory access patterns
        Algorithm behavior
        Compiler optimization for memory access
