Winter 2005 Final
1.
    General case
        Load - stall 2 cycles
        R-type - stall 1 cycle
    Forwarding
        Load - stall 1 cycle
        R-type - no stall
    Load value is taken from MEM/WB latch
    R-type value is taken from EX/MEM latch

2.
    Page size - determine number of bits in an address  
        16KB pages = 2^14 bits
    Offset - number of bits determined by the block size
        8 byte block size means 3 bits
    Index - number of bits determined by the number of blocks
        Cache size / block size / n (-way set))
    TLB hit or miss - determined by the most significant bits
        If address given was 16 bits, then TLB hit or miss is determined by the most significant 2 bits
